# 🛒 Amazon Homepage Clone – HTML & CSS

This is a static clone of the Amazon homepage built using only **HTML and CSS**. The project replicates Amazon’s landing page layout, including a top navigation bar with logo, search bar, language selector, account links, and cart icon. It also includes a promotional hero section, multiple product category boxes styled in a grid, and a detailed footer. 

The goal of this project was to practice front-end layout building using **Flexbox**, **CSS Grid**, and responsive design techniques — without using JavaScript. Icons are integrated using **Font Awesome**, and custom images are used for visuals.
